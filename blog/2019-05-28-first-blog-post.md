Building production-ready NestJS libraries requires careful consideration of performance, reliability, and developer experience. In this post, I'll share insights from developing enterprise-grade libraries.

## Key Principles

When building libraries for enterprise use, several principles guide the development process:

### 1. Zero-Configuration Defaults
Libraries should work out of the box with sensible defaults while allowing customization when needed.

### 2. Performance First
Every feature should be designed with performance in mind, especially for high-throughput scenarios.

### 3. Developer Experience
Clear APIs, comprehensive documentation, and helpful error messages make libraries adoption-friendly.

### 4. Production Readiness
Built-in monitoring, health checks, and graceful error handling are essential for enterprise environments.

These principles have guided the development of libraries like the NestJS Kafka Client, which delivers enterprise-grade messaging capabilities with minimal configuration.
