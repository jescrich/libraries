Creating interactive documentation helps developers understand complex concepts through hands-on examples. This post demonstrates how to build engaging documentation using MDX.

## Interactive Code Examples

Here's an interactive example of URN validation:

```typescript
import { URN } from '@jescrich/urn';

// Try different URN formats
const urn = new URN('urn:example:resource:123');
console.log(urn.isValid()); // true
```

<button onClick={() => {
  const urn = 'urn:example:resource:' + Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
  alert(`Generated URN: ${urn}`);
}}>Generate Random URN</button>

## Benefits of Interactive Documentation

Interactive documentation provides several advantages:

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Developers can see results instantly
2. **Learning by Doing**: Hands-on examples improve understanding
3. **Reduced Friction**: No need to set up local environments for testing

This approach is particularly effective for demonstrating library APIs and complex configuration options.
